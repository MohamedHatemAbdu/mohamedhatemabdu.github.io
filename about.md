I have been coding since 2014 at the cool smarthphones of Android, building neat responsive user interface, maintaining, developing new features and debugging no produceable scenario bugs.

In my daily work, I always trying to bring a maintainable, extensible and well designed software beside commiting with getting the job done to meet the harsh deadlines.


I am using my "20% time" to understand new concepts and learning tools and technologies so that I can excel in delivering a well designed software, applying the best practices and making the software well archticted where the design helping in fast delievery and ease of maintinig not for making the code only looks beautiful.


In this blog, I will share some of my very tiny knowledge as well as some of obstacles that I face in my daily life work and how I fixed it. 

When I am not coding, I probably hanging out with my family. Otherwise, I probably watching football games bacause I do love seeing how the coaches manage the game through their tactics and how they work for a long time in building and training a team of 11 players to implement a specific tactic.
